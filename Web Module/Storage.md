<h3>D. Storage - Amazon S3</h3><br>
<h4>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a web service-based interface that simplifies data processing anytime, anywhere.<br>
<b>Outline </b>- This lab is designed to help users learn how to save, check, move, and delete data using S3. You can also see the ability to host simple static web pages using S3's static website hosting functionality.

<h4>ands-on Lab Sequence</h4>

The order of this lab is as follows.
<ul>
<li>Create Bucket on S3</li>
<li>Adding objects to buckets</li>
<li>View objects</li>
<li>Enable Static Web Site Hosting</li>
<li>Move objects</li>
<li>Enable Bucket versioning</li>
<li>Deleting objects and buckets</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Create Bucket on S3</h4>
<ol>
<li>From the AWS Management Console, connect to S3 . Press Create bucket to create a bucket.</li>

<li>Enter a unique bucket name in the Bucket name field. For this lab, type immersion-day-user_name, substituiting user-name with your name. All bucket names in Amazon S3 have to be unique and cannot be duplicated. 
In the Region drop-down box, specify the region to create the bucket. In this lab, select the region closest to you. The images will show the US-East(N.virginia) region. Object Ownership change to ACLs enabled. 
Bucket settings for Block Public Access use default values, and select Create bucket in the lower right corner.</li>

<br>
<h4>Note - Bucket names must comply with these rules:
Can contain lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and dashes (-).
Must start with a number or letter.
Can be specified from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 255 characters in length.
Cannot be specified in the format like the IP address (e.g., 265.255.5.4).</h4><br>
<li>A bucket has been created on Amazon S3.</li>

<br>
<h4>NOTE - There are no costs incurred for creating bucket. You pay for storing objects in your S3 buckets. 
The rate youâ€™re charged depends on the region you are using, your objects' size, how long you stored the 
bjects during the month, and the storage class. There are also per-request fees. Click for more information.</h4>
<br>
<h4>Adding Objects to Bucket</h4>
This lab hosts static websites through S3. The static website serves as a redirect to an instance created by the VPC Lab when you click on a particular image. Therefore, prepare one image file, one HTML file, and an ALB DNS name.
<ol>
<li>Download the image file <a href="https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/dd38a0a0-ae47-43f1-9065-f0bbcb15f684/static/common/s3_advanced_lab/aws.png">aws.png</a>and save it as aws.png.</li>
<li>Write index.html using the source code below.</li>
<img width="602" alt="S3 index file" src="https://github.com/manas0120/Highly-Available-Multi-Tier-Web-Application/assets/60257363/1bf194fd-180d-4224-a7da-964d992376af">

<br>

<li>Upload the aws.png file to S3. Click S3 Bucket that you just created</li>

<li>Click the Upload button. Then click the Add files button. Select the pre-downloaded aws.png file through File Explorer. Alternatively, place the file in Drag and Drop to the screen.</li>

<li>Check the file information named aws.png to upload, then click the Upload button at the bottom.</li>

<li>Check the URL information to fill in the image URL in index.html file. 
Select the uploaded aws.png file and copy the Object URL information from the details on the right.</li>

<li>Paste Object URL into the image URL part of the index.html. 
Then specify the ALB DNS Name of the load balancer created by Deploy auto scaling web service to redirect to ALB when you click on the image.</li>

<li>If you check the objects in your S3 bucket, you should see 2 files.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<h3>VIEW OBJECTS</h3>
<li>In the Amazon S3 Console, please click the object you want to see. You can see detailed information about the object as shown below.</li>
 
NOTE - By default, all objects in the S3 bucket are owner-only(Private). To determine the object through a URL of the same format as https://{Bucket}.s3.{region}.amazonaws.com/{Object}, you must grant Read permission for external users to read it. Alternatively, you can create a signature-based Signed URL that contains credentials for that object, allowing unauthorized users to access it temporarily.



<li>select the Permissions tab in the bucket. To modify the application of Block public access (bucket settings), press the right Edit button.</li>

<h3>Enable Static Hosting</h3>
<h4>A static website refers to a website that contains static content (HTML, image, video) or client-side scripts (Javascript) on a web page. In contrast, dynamic websites require server-side processing, including server-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Server-side scripting is not supported on Amazon S3. If you want to host a dynamic website, you can use other services such as EC2 on AWS.
</h4>
<ol>

 click the Properties tab. Scroll down and click the Edit button on 
 Static website hosting.</li>
 <li>Activate the static website hosting function and select the hosting type and enter the index.html value in the Index document value, then click the save changes button.</li>
