# Highly-Available-Multi-Tier-Web-Application
Specifically, we will walk through the following topics`:
1. Network – Amazon VPC
2. Compute – Amazon EC2
3. Database – Amazon Aurora
4. Storage – Amazon S3
5. Clean up resource.

A. Network - Amazon VPC -
   In this lab, we'll create not only one Public Subnet and one Private Subnet in two Availability Zone(AZ-a, AZ-c) but also one NAT Gateway placed on the Public Subnet through VPC Wizard. After configuring these resources, you will set up a routing table to define the network traffic flow. Through these tasks, you can complete a basic networking configuration to create a highly available and scalable web service environment.
